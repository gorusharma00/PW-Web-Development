### Steps to contributing to any open-source project

1. Choose a Project: 
    * Browse GitHub Explore (https://github.com/explore) or search for projects related to your skills and interests.

2. Understand the Project:
    * Thoroughly read the project's documentation and contributing guidelines. These will explain the project's purpose, coding style, expected workflow, and how they prefer contributions.

    * Familiarize yourself with the codebase by exploring the repository and its structure.

3. Find an Issue to Work on:
    * Look for open issues labeled "bug," "enhancement," or "good first issue." These are potential areas where you can contribute.

    * Choose an issue that aligns with your skills and interests, and ensure you can dedicate the necessary time to complete it effectively.

4.  Fork and Clone the Repository

5. Create a Branch and Make Changes:
    * Create a new branch in your local repository specifically for your contribution. This helps keep your changes isolated and avoids affecting the main project codebase.

    * Make the necessary changes to the codebase to address the chosen issue.

    * Follow the project's coding style and formatting guidelines for consistency.

6. Test your changes.

7. Commit your changes

8. Push your changes and Create a pull request

9. Review and Collaboration:
    * The project maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

    * Respond promptly to any questions or requests for modifications.

### Git Workflow

* The Git workflow defines a structured approach to managing changes in your project using the Git version control system. It involves three key components.

#### Components:

* <b>Working Directory:</b> This is the local directory on your computer where you actually work on your project's files. It contains the current version of the codebase you're actively modifying.

* <b>Staging Area:</b> This is a temporary storage area within Git. Think of it as a holding zone where you select specific changes (files or portions of code) from your working directory that you want to be included in the next commit. You can add, remove, and review the changes staged before creating a commit.

* <b>Repository (Repo):</b> This is the central storage location for your project's entire version history. It can be a local directory on your machine or a remote repository hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

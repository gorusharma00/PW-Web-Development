### GitHub

* GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a centralized place for code hosting and collaborative software development.

* It utilizes the Git version control system as its foundation.

* It offers a wide range of features including issue tracking, project management tools and integrations with other development tools.

#### How GitHub Facilitates Collaboration and Version Control

* GitHub acts as a single shared repository for your project, accessible by multiple developers from anywhere with an internet connection.

*  Developers can create isolated "branches" to suggest changes and experiment without impacting the main code. These branches can then be reviewed and cleanly merged back into the main codebase.

* When a developer proposes changes, they submit a "pull request" that allows others to review the modifications, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before merging the changes.

#### Alternatives of GitHub

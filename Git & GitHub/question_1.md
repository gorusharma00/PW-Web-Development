### Version Control

* Version control, also known as source control, is a crucial practice in software development for managing and tracking changes made to code and other project files over time. It utilizes version control systems (VCS), which are specialized software tools that act like a historical record of your project's evolution.

#### Importance:

* <b> Tracking Changes:</b> It keeps a detailed log of every modification made to the code, including who made them, when they were made, and the specific changes introduced. This allows developers to:
    * Identify the source of bugs or regressions.
    * Understand the evolution of the code

* <b>Collaboration and Conflict Resolution:</b> When multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously, version control prevents conflicts and facilitates seamless collaboration.

* <b> Rollback and Recovery:</b>  If a problem arises due to a recent change, version control allows developers to "roll back" to a previous, stable version of the codebase.

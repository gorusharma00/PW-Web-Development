## Unary Operators
A unary operator operates on a single operand, which comes before or after the operator.

```
let a =10;
-a // -10
```

## Binary Operators
Binary operator operates on two operands.

```
let a = 10;
let b = 12;
let sum = a + b //22
let product = a * b // 120
```

## Ternary Operators
The ternary operator is unique in that it is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement.

```
let result = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

let age = 20;
let result = (age>=18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
```

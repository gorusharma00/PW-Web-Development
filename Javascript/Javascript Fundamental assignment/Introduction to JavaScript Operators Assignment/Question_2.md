## Arithmetic Operators
Perform basic mathematical operations.

```
let a = 10;
let b = 2;
let addition = a + b;    // 12
let subtraction = a - b; // 8
let multiplication = a * b; // 20
let division = a / b;    // 5
```
## Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return a boolean result.

```
let a = 10;
let b = 2;
let isEqual = (a ==b); //false
let isNotEqual = (a != b); //true
```

## Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables.

```
let a = 10;
a += 5; //15
a -= 5; //5
a *= 5 //50
```
## Logical Operators
Perform logical operations on boolean values.

```
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
let andOperator = (isTrue && isFalse); // false
let orOperator = (isTrue || isFalse);  // true
```
## Unary Operators
Unary Operators are operators that perform actions on single operand.

```
let string = "45";
let num = +string ; converts 45 string into 45 number
```

## Operator Precedence
Operator precedence refers to the priority given to operators while parsing a statement that has more than one operator performing operations in it.

## Precedence
Precedence is used to tell the compiler what operations should be performed first. 

```
let result = 2 + 3 * 4  // result = 24 because 3 * 4 is evaluated first
```

## Associativity
Associativity in general states that irrespective of the order of operands for a given operation the result remains the same. 

```
let result_1 = 2 + ( 3 + 4) // 9
let result_2 = (2 + 3) + 4 // 9 (Bot gives same result)
```

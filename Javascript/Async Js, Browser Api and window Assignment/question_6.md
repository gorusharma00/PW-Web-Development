#### The <i>localStorage</i> and <i>sessionStorage</i> APIs are part of the Web Storage API and provide mechanisms for web applications to store data in a user's browser.

### localStorage API:

* The localStorage object stores data with no expiration time. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year unless explicitly deleted. This makes it useful for saving long-term data, like user preferences or form data.

### sessionStorage API:

* The sessionStorage object is similar to localStorage, but it stores data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab. This makes it useful for data that needs to persist across multiple pages in a single browsing session, but not beyond that.

### Browser APIs

* <b>Document Object Model (DOM) API:</b> This API allows JavaScript to manipulate the structure, style, and content of a webpage. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree-like object, allowing developers to add, modify, or delete HTML elements and attributes.



* <b>Fetch API:</b> This API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set to handle requests and responses for resources on a network. It is a modern alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest and uses Promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write.



* <b>Geolocation API:</b> This API allows JavaScript to get geographical information about the user, given their consent. It can be used to provide location-specific features, like showing nearby restaurants or weather information.

* <b>Canvas API:</b>  This API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and HTML. It can be used for everything from simple animations to complex interactive games.

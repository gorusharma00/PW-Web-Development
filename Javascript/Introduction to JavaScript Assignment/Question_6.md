## Importance of Variable names

- When naming the variables, we must consider making the names descriptive and easily understandable. 
-  This will make our program easy to read and understand in the future when we have to refactor it. 

### Example of clear identifier
If we have to store someone name so we can use that gives more clear information what are we storing in it.

```
let name = "Aryan"
const email = "yourEmail@yahoo.com"
```

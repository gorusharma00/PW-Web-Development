## Operators
Operators in javascript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands and produce a result.

## Why they are essential

- JavaScript includes operators for basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) etc.

- It includes comparison operators. Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=) are used to compare values. They return a Boolean result, which is crucial for making decisions in conditional statements.

- It also includes assignment operators. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) are used to assign values to variables. They play a fundamental role in storing and manipulating data in a program.

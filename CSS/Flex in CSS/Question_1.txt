Main differences bewteen CSS Flexbox Layout Model and CSS Grid Layout Model:-

1. CSS Grid is designed for a two-dimensional layout while Flexbox is for one. This means Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both.

2. Flexbox gives you more flexibility while working on either element (row or column).

3. Grid gives you more flexibility to move around the blocks irrespective of your HTML markup.

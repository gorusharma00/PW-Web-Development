        <dt><b>HTML:</b></dt>
        <dd>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It defines the meaning and structure of web content. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages. HTML consists the series of elements, these elements tells the browser how to display the content. HTML basically contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</dd>

        <dd>
            JavaScript(js) is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It can be used for both client-side as well as server-side developments. JavaScript is also known as scripting language for web pages. JavaScript is an advanced programming language that makes web pages more interactive and dynamic.

        <dt><b>ReactJs:</b></dt>
        <dd>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications. React allows us to create reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.</dd>
        <dt><b>NodeJs:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Node.js is an open source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime enviornment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project. Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

        <dt><b>MongoDb:</b></dt>
        <dd>

MongoDB is a most used cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high availability, high performance and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document the data.  MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form. This makes it easy to operate with dynamic and unstructured data.

        <dt><b>ExpressJS:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It can be used to design single-page, multi-page and hybrid web applications. It makes it easier to organize your application's functionality with middleware and routing.

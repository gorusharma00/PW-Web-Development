    <h2>Welcome to Web Blogs</h2>
    <p>
      Hi I am Gourav Sharma, this is my website to read and write blogs. You can
      find all the blogs as per your choices.

      <h3>&#9776; The Top 5 Longreads of the Week</h3>
      <p>
        This week we are highlighting stories from Tom Lamont, Charlotte Alter,
        Dženana Vucic, John Paul Scotto, and Devin Friedman.
      </p>
      <h3>&#9776; The Great Psychedelic Experiment</h3>
      <p>Researchers mined an old drug forum and fed the entries to an AI. The result could augur a new class of psychedelic-based antidepressants.
      </p>
      <h3>&#9776; I Remember Arthur</h3>
      <p>A writer examines his own depression and suicidal ideation after losing an enigmatic friend and a deeply personal book draft.
      </p>
      <h3>&#9776; Librarians on the Front Lines: A Reading List for Library Lovers and Realists</h3>
      <p>
        Increasingly, being a librarian is less and less about books and more and more about community survival.
      </p>
      <h3>&#9776; The Obsessive Life and Mysterious Death of the Fisherman Who Discovered The Loch Ness Monster</h3>
      <p>
        Writing this Narratively Classic, originally published in December 2020, sent me on an entertaining deep dive into one of the world's most popular mysteries. But I wasn't interested in rehashing a well-known tale. Instead, I was drawn to the virtually unknown story of Sandy Gray, a bus driver and fisherman from the banks of Loch Ness. His encounters with something strange in the water changed his life and played an overlooked part in the creation of the "Loch Ness Monster" legend. I always want to uncover unusual stories featuring interesting characters with cinematic arcs. It's what I do on my Substack, Singular Discoveries. Sandy's story was a real gift of a find, with a great arc for his character, surrounded by all the colorful craziness of the early monster sightings. That craziness obscured Sandy's place in the legend for almost a century. I hope that telling his story here means he'll no longer be forgotten.

        <h1>Web Design :-</h1>
        <p>Web design is the art of planning and arranging content on a website so that it can be shared and accessed online with the world. A combination of aesthetic and functional elements, web design is a type of digital design that determines the look of a website—such as its colors, fonts, graphics and user interface (see our guide on website design best practices). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, creating a website is one of the pillars of having an online presence. Because of this, the world of web design is as dynamic as ever. It is constantly evolving, including mobile apps and user interface design, to meet the growing needs of website owners and visitors alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web design is often a collaborative process that combines knowledge and tools from related industries, ranging from web design statistics to SEO optimization and UX. Web designers will often bring together professionals from these areas who can optimize performance and focus on the larger process and outcome.

        <h3>&#9758; What is Responsive Web Design?</h3>
        <p>
            Responsive Web Design (a.k.a. "Responsive" or "Responsive Design") is an approach to design web content that appears regardless of the resolution governed by the device. It's typically accomplished with viewport breakpoints (resolution cut-offs for when content scales to that view). The viewports should adjust logically on tablets, phones, and desktops of any resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsive designs respond to changes in browser width by adjusting the placement of design elements to fit in the available space. If you open a responsive site on the desktop and change the browser window's size, the content will dynamically rearrange itself to fit the browser window. The site checks for the available space on mobile phones and then presents itself in the ideal arrangement.

            &#9758; Best Practices and Considerations for Responsive Design
        </h3>
        <p>
            With responsive design, you design for flexibility in every aspect—images, text and layouts. So, you should:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Take the mobile-first approach—start the product design process for mobile devices first instead of desktop devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create fluid grids and images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prioritize the use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs). These are an XML-based file format for 2D graphics, which supports interactivity and animations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aim for minimalism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apply design patterns to maximize ease of use for users in their contexts and quicken their familiarity: e.g., the column drop pattern fits content to many screen types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aim for accessibility.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

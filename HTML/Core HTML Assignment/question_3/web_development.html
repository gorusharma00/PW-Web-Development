        Web Development
    </h1>
    <p>
        Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

    <h2>
        &#9758; What Exactly is Web Development?
    </h2>
    <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).</p>

        <h3>&#9758; What Are the Most Common Programming Languages?</h3>
        <p>The most common programming languages involved in web development are:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</li>
                <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>&#9758; Types of Web Development</h3>
        <p>There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.</p>

        <h3><u>Front-End Development</u></h3>
        <p>Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say usually, front-end web development refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.</p>

        <h3><u>Back-End Development</u></h3>
        <p>
            If Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-End Developers are focused on how it works. A Back-End Developer creates the basic framework of a website before maintaining it and ensuring it performs the way it should, including database interactions, user authentication, server, network and hosting configuration, and business logic. Working behind the scenes or server-side Back End Developers are concerned with the systems and structures that allow computer applications to perform as desired.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <u>Full-Stack Developer</u>
        </h3>
        <p>A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. Full Stack Developers usually understand a wide variety of programming languages and because of their versatility, they might be given more of a leadership role on projects than developers who specialize. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers according to an Indeed study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.</p>
